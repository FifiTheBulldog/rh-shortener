# rh-shortener

A simple URL shortener for [RoutineHub](https://routinehub.co). It uses HTTP 301 redirects rather than client-side JavaScript to redirect to RoutineHub.

This is written using only the built-in modules of Node.JS. It has been tested both locally and on [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/rhsh), and is designed to be hosted on similar services.
